# ðŸš› RoadDuty â€” Intelligent Hours of Service Planning Engine

**RoadDuty** is a modern TypeScript engine that automatically **simulates, validates, and generates** compliant schedules for truck drivers based on the **FMCSA Hours of Service (HOS)** regulations.

It models real-world logistics operations â€” including driving, loading, resting, and on-duty periods â€” while ensuring full compliance with U.S. law.  
Built with **Next.js**, **React**, and **Nuqs**, it powers both backend automation and real-time visual dashboards for fleets, dispatchers, and drivers.
